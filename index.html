    about me
  </h2>
  <p>
    i'm at the university of illinois urbana-champaign majoring in computer science + linguistics and
    minoring in math. i'm interested in ai,nlp, programming language theory, and systems software. specifically, i have
    done research in the past on
    nlp alongside <a href="https://elisaf.github.io">dr. elisa ferracane<a />. i'm also an ardent linux user and i
      currently daily
      drive <s>fedora</s> arch linux on my framework laptop (although the more i look at it, the more i get enthralled
      with the idea of <a href="https://nixos.org/">nixos</a>). currently, i'm the treasurer for <a
        href="acm.illinois.edu">ACM@UIUC</a> - the largest
      collective of CS students at Illinois - where i manage funds and enable many students across the club to pursue
      their passions and build projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    outside of academics, i was a policy debate competitor in high school, and i am continuing this activity in
    college by
    coaching a group of highly motivated high schoolers from small programs, similar to the one i was from. i also
    enjoy playing many old Nintendo games and enjoy being part of the homebrew scene for many of these older consoles.
    a not so long time ago, i went to fox chapel area high school.

  <p>
    i'm working on a blog! it's not done yet, but i hope to detail my various journeys from the internals of this
    website (which is only very slightly more than raw text) to my dotfiles on my arch install and more!

    why does this page look like this

  <p>
    i swear i know CSS, JS, and other modern frontend frameworks. however, <a href="https://nocss.club/">imho, we dont
      need to be doing all that most of the time</a>. </p>
