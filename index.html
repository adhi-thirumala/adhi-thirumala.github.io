    About me
</h2>
<p>
    I'm a rising freshman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science + Linguistics. I'm interested in both AI and NLP, and have done research in the past with it. I'm also interested in low-level programming and am currently reading/working through the exercises in <i>The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles</i> by Nisam and Shocken.
    Outside of academics, I was a policy debater in high school, and I am continuing this activity in college by coaching an undisclosed (for now) team in high school. I also enjoy playing many old Nintendo games and hope to enter the homebrew development scene for these consoles after I gain more knowledge in the field. I went to Fox Chapel Area High School previously, and graduated in 2024.
